AFS WebDAV Gateway
Joe Presbrey <presbrey@mit.edu>

= Installation =

== 1. Install Kerberos and OpenAFS ==

 # yum install -y krb5-workstation openafs-client openafs-krb5

Test kinit, aklog, and `ls /afs/path` at the console now.
If OpenAFS does not work at the prompt now, it will not work over HTTP later.

== 2. Install the gateway ==
Unpack the gateway to a convenient path, for example /home/afsdav,
referred to as $DAV_BASE in the OS

Create a path for subprocess-writable (lighttpd-writable) tempfiles.
By default, lighttpd runs as user `nobody`.  Make sure
this directory is writable by this user.

If you are not at MIT, delete the automount path at $DAV_BASE/srv/mit.

== 3. Build lighttpd ==
Our webserver needs specific compile flags and a few patches.
Use the Makefile provided under ./src:

 $ cd src; make

== 4. Add supervisor config ==
Symlink the provided etc/supervisor.ini file under /etc/supervisor.d
or use your own process manager to forever run the daemons.

Installation completed!
